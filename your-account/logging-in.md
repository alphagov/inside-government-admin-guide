## Logging in


1. We have two separate environments in Publisher:

   Use Preview if you're practising - [https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk)

   Use Production if you want the content to go live - [https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk)

   Content will not be copied from Preview to Production under any circumstances, so please check where you’re creating new content.

2. You may be prompted for the ‘betademo’ username and password.

   Username: betademo
