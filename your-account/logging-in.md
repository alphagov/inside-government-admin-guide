## Logging in


1. We have two separate publisher environments

   Use Preview if you're practicising
	
   [https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk)

   Use Production if you want the content to go live

   [https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk)

   Content will not be copied from Preview to Production under any circumstances, so please check where you’re creating new content.
