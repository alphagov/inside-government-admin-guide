title: How to publish content on GOV.UK - Logging in
---

## Logging in


We have 2 separate environments in Publisher.

* Use Preview if you're practising - [https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk).
* Use Production if you want the content to go live - [https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk).

(All content on Preview is overwritten every week, so it is not a good place to create any documents you wish to keep.)

* You should be prompted for the ‘betademo’ username and password (same for all users).

* Next enter your official government email address and your chosen passphrase.

You will land on the dashboard, from which you can access your draft documents, support and more. Find out more about [using your dashboard](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/your-account/your-dashboard).
