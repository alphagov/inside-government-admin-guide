## Forgot your passphrase?

This is also useful if you want to trigger a welcome email so you can get started.

* Go to the Preview (practice/mock-ups) or Production (live) environment, depending on which one you’ve forgotten the password for.

   * [https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk)
   * [https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk)

* You should be prompted for the ‘betademo’ username and password.

* Next click the 'Forgot your passphrase?' link (clicking more than once will delay your access to Publisher).

Password reset instructions will be sent to the email address if it is registered with us.
