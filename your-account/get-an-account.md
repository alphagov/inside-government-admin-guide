## Get an account

We have 2 separate environments, Production and Preview, and you need to create an account on each.

* You'll receive 2 emails inviting you to create these accounts.
* Click on the 'Accept invitation' link in each email and follow the steps below for each account.

If you have not received an email, check your spam/junk folder. If you still can't find it but believe that you have been registered, follow the steps for [forgot password](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/your-account/forgot-your-password.html) to trigger an email. 
   
* Set a password that’s strong but memorable.
