## Log in


We have 2 separate environments in Publisher.

* Use Preview if you're practising - [https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.preview.alphagov.co.uk).
* Use Production if you want the content to go live - [https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk).

(All content on Preview is overwritten every week, so it's not a good place to create any documents you wish to keep.)

* You should be prompted for the username and password. This is NOT your personal username and password but the one that's the same for all users.

* Next enter your email address and your chosen passphrase.

You will land on the dashboard, from which you can access your draft documents, support and more. Find out more about [using your dashboard](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/first-steps/your-dashboard.html).
