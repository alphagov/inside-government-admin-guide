# Create and populate collections 

Collections are for thematically linked documents, such as all the forms and guidance relating to a particular product type or used by people carrying out a particular task. As a rough indicator, a collection would be too big if it contained all the guidance for a profession or all the content for a whole subject. For these, GOV.UK offers 'categories' and 'topics'. When deciding what to put into a collection, think of meeting a user need in an efficient and convenient way. A collection lists the documents it contains and they can be divided into sub-sections called groups. Collections appear in search results and are weighted to appear higher than a single document.

### Create a collection

It is best if the documents you want to put into the collection are already created and you have the slugs to hand (the end part of their GOV.UK URL - eg 'public-health-outcomes-framework').

* From the main navigation, click on 'New document' and select 'Document collection'.
* Write the title and summary in a way that explains the reason and purpose for the collection to a user who sees it in search results, following the [style for titles and summaries](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/detailedguides).
* Write a sentence or 2 in the body section - this introduces the list.
* Complete the tagging as for any other document. 
* Save your work; the 'Collection documents' tab will appear.

### Populate the collection

* Click on the 'Collection documents' tab and start adding documents to your collection - you find the documents you want by entering the slug in the search box, but search terms work too.
* Click on the 'Add' button for each document.

### Allocate documents to groups

You can create the groups and allocate publications, detailed guides, speeches or news to them. 

* Create each group using 'Add a new group' button - note that the 'body' text is not mandatory.
* Switch existing documents into your new group by selecting them and then using the 'Move' blue button.

You can also add documents directly into a group using the 'Add' button.
