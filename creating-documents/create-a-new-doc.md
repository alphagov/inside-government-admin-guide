# Create a new document

Before you create a document you need to be sure you have selected the [correct type and sub-type](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/document-types.html) for your content. You also need to have read the style guide in detail so that you know [how to write for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide).

To create a publication, you need to have the publication itself to hand, as a PDF or other format. A publication is a document that has been officially released by your agency or department into the public domain. 

From the documents list, click the ‘Create new document’ button.

### Title and summary

There is general guidance in the style guide on how to write [titles and summaries](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/detailedguides#detailed-guides), explaining the importance of plain English on GOV.UK. You should also check the style guide on specific content types (eg transparency data, consultations) as there is guidance on how to write titles for each one, with examples.

Titles must:

* be maximum 65 characters 
* use active voice (for guidance) 
* be front loaded with search engine optimisation terms
* be fully in context
* avoid re-use of the content type, the speaker's name (for speeches) or the organisation name - these are all shown on the page and in search results

Summaries must:

* explain what is in the content
* be full sentences or clear descriptions with a full stop
* be maximum 140 characters
* incorporate keywords and names that might be used in search

### Body copy

* You can type directly into the text box for 'Body' or paste in any text from other sources. It does not need to be plain text.
* Use the simple commands on the right of the page - called [Markdown](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/markdown.html) - to format headings, links, quotes and more.
* When you've formatted your text, click the preview toggle to see what your page will look like (toggle straight back to edit as this does not save your work).
* Assign a [document sub-type](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/document-types.html).
* Assign a lead department (this will be defaulted to your own department).
* Assign an email address for ordering this publication in an alternative format - choose from drop-down list and consult with your transition manager or department lead editor if you are not sure which one is correct.

### Save the document

* 'Save' will return you to the main document list.
* 'Save and continue editing' lets you return to your document to add either [attachments](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-attachments.html) or [associations](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-associations.html) or both.
* 'Cancel' will stop the creation of your document.
