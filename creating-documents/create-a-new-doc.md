## Create a new document

Before you create a document you need to be sure you have selected the [correct type and sub-type](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/document-types.html) for your content. You also need to have read the style guide in detail so that you know [how to write for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide).


From the documents list, click the ‘Create new document’ button.

## Title and summary

There is general guidance on how to write [titles and summaries](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/detailedguides#detailed-guides). You should also check the style guide on specific content types (eg transparency data) as there is guidance on how to write titles for each one.

## Body copy

* You can type directly into the text box for 'Body' or paste in any text from other sources. It does not need to be plain text.
* Use the simple commands on the right of the page - called [Markdown](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/markdown.html) - to format headings, links, quotes and more.
* When you've formatted your text, click the preview toggle to see what your page will look like (toggle straight back to edit as this does not save your work).
* Assign a [document sub-type](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/document-types.html).
* Assign a lead department (this will be defaulted to your own department).
* Assign an email address for ordering this publication in an alternative format - choose from drop-down list and consult with your transition manager or department lead editor if you are not sure which one is correct.

Make sure you save your work. 

* 'Save' will return you to the document listing.
* 'Save and continue editing' will take you back to the document to add images or attachments, make associations or re-edit content.
* 'Cancel' will stop the creation of your document.

For most documents, you will need to add either [attachments](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-attachments.html) or [associations](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-associations.html) or both, so you will need to continue editing.
