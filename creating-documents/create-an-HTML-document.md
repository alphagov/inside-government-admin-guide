## Create an HTML publication

First, create a publication page to house your HTML publication. [See guidance on creating a publication page.](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/create-a-new-doc.html)

* Scroll down to below the page body text to the box for HTML version.

* Give the publication a title and summary, just as you would when attaching a file.
* In the body text, use Markdown to format the text just as in the rest of Publisher.
* Give the publication H2s using the \#\# Markdown - these are listed as bookmarks at the top so users can navigate the section.
* Attach files to your page and position them in your publication using the usual Markdown.
