##Requests to delete or unpublish documents

Only departmental 'single points of contact' (SPOCs) can ask GDS to unpublish content. Contact your SPOC if you need to do this. Include the internal Publisher and live GOV.UK URLs in your request.

SPOCs need to log in and use the [support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk) to make these requests (one form per request).

Removing GOV.UK content after it’s been published is a poor experience for users so please only do this when necessary.

##Requests for short URLs

URLs are automatically created from the page title when you publish the page. They cannot be changed and the path is fixed by Publisher. 

Decisions on creating short URLs are made by GDS based on user need. It is useful if you read [our blog post on friendly URLs](http://inside-inside-gov.tumblr.com/post/47775179301/short-urls-for-organisations-profile-pages) before getting in touch.


##Impossible requests

Please note that the following tasks cannot be carried out in Publisher:

* changing the URL of a page (you will need to create a new page and fix the URL to what you want, then request a deletion and redirection using the [support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk)
* duplicating a page (you’ll need to create a new page and use copy and paste)
* moving a page from Preview to Production (you’ll need create a new page and use copy and paste)
* changing a document’s type (eg from a news story to a publication)
