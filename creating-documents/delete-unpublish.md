##Requests to delete or unpublish documents

Only departmental 'single points of contact' ('SPOCs') can ask GDS to unpublish content. Contact your SPOC if you need to do this. Include the internal Publisher and live GOV.UK URLs in your request.
Permanently ‘disappearing’ government content after it’s been published is a poor experience for users so please only do this when necessary.
