title: How to publish content / Add contacts to a page
---

Please note this manual is a draft version and will be revised shortly.

If your contact doesn't exist in publisher yet, you'll need to [create it](/inside-government-admin-guide/organisations-groups/organisation-home-page.html#add_contacts).

# Add contacts to a page

While editing any field that supports Markdown, begin typing the Markdown command to insert a contact, using this Markdown: \[contact:

A dialogue box will appear, listing a few contacts, like this:

![Add contact dialogue](http://media.tumblr.com/ec85c10fdb0c269e37afdeab9ab28db6/tumblr_inline_mo0kfbXbSh1qz4rgp.png)

Continue typing to filter the entire database of organisation contacts and bring up relevant matches. For example, if you type 'Defra', it will show all the contacts belonging to Defra:

![Add contact dialogue 2](http://media.tumblr.com/b4f2c9406275d60ff91873fabd7fd5b9/tumblr_inline_mo0khiHqvn1qz4rgp.png)

It will also return matches for the title of the contact itself, for example here is what happens if you type 'FOI':

![Add contact dialogue 3](http://media.tumblr.com/d52b80731ac58337d5d7c46ecf871f56/tumblr_inline_mo0kkoVjzO1qz4rgp.png)

Click on the contact you want to insert, and your Markdown command will be automatically completed using the relevant contact reference number.

It’s a good idea to click the preview toggle to double-check it’s the contact you wanted.
