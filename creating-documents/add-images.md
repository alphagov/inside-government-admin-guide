## Add images and videos

### Add images

Images can be added to news articles, speeches, case studies, detailed guides and supporting detail pages on policies.

* Upload an image by clicking the 'Choose file' button (accepted types are jpg, png, gif). 
* All images should be 960 x 640 pixels, 72dpi minimum, landscape. [Pixlr.com](http://www.pixlr.com) is a good place to go to resize images.
* Use alt text where you need to help users understand the visual content. If an image is not essential to understanding the content, use “”. For more details about alt tags and captions, see the [style guide 4.2](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/insidegovernment#images).
* When you've picked an image to use, another ‘new image’ box automatically appears so you can pick more.

* Click 'Save and continue editing' to ensure the images have uploaded correctly - all the images will now be assigned numbers and a Markdown code to use - the first is !!1, the second is !!2 and so on. This code can be used to make each image appear within your page.
* A pink error message will appear if the image is the wrong size or type.

You can position images where you like within a document.

* Type \!! and the image's number at the point in the text where you’d like it to appear, with an empty line space above and below. 	
* Save the document again and your images will be placed in the text automatically, and can be [viewed using the Preview button](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/preview-your-work.html).
* If you see a box with a cross in it, then your image is being virus checked, but it has uploaded correctly.

Note that for news stories, the first image (!!1) will appear in the left margin of the page so you don't need to place it in your text (if you do, it will not appear). The subsequent images can be positioned using !!2, !!3 etc.

This video demonstration shows you how to add an image in Publisher.

### Add videos

You can embed videos directly into your page using Markdown. Only YouTube videos will work at present.

* Put the title of the video in square brackets and next to it in round brackets (no space) the URL of the YouTube page that shows the video for watching. Don’t use the embed code or the 'Share this video' URL.
* Leave a line space above and below your link, and don’t use a bullet point.
* The video will display in an embedded media player automatically.
