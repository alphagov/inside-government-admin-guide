# Statistical announcements

Do not create or modify statistics or statistics announcements unless you have authorisation from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).

##How statistical announcements work

When you create a statistical announcement it generates a calendar entry on the [statistics release calendar](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/announcements). They are similar to calendar entries on the PubHub.

You should then create the draft publication in Publisher, linked to the announcement. Once the statistics document is published, the announcement will no longer show in the release calendar. You need to create a publication even if the statistics publication will not be published on GOV.UK.

##How to write text for a statistical announcement

If you’re creating a new announcement, first search GOV.UK for anything similar. You should match title style from previous publications where you can.

##Titles

A release title should:

* be under 65 characters 
* describe the statistics in the release in plain English 
* include the coverage and time the statistics relate to
* not include the word ‘statistics’ - it’s already on the page 
* be in sentence case 
* be [optimised for search](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles/style-guide/style-points#style-titles) (frontload the most important information)
* include colons instead of hyphens or dashes (for screen readers)
* not contain jargon or technical language
* spell out abbreviations or acronyms (unless well known, for example, UK, VAT or EU)

Good examples: 
'House building in England: October to December 2014’

‘UK overseas trade statistics: non-EU February 2014’

‘Cereal use by UK brewers, distillers and maltsters: November 2014’

Search engines cut off titles after about 65 characters. This can lead to unhelpful truncation.

##Summary

The summary gives more information about the statistic, and will show in most search engine results. It should:

* be under 140 characters (including spaces)
* expand on the title without repeating it
* explain what the release is about in plain English (no jargon)
* 'frontload' the most important information at the beginning (not 'This release provides...')
* end with a full stop (for people using screen readers)
* explain any acronyms used in the title

Examples:

‘Staff headcount by sector and industry for central and local government and public corporations.’

‘A breakdown of Jobseeker's Allowance claimant count statistics, after changes to eligibility rules for Income Support from November 2008.’

All text needs to be checked by the writer and another person before it is published, to avoid errors.

##How to publish a new statistics announcement 

Go to the ‘Statistics announcements’ tab in Publisher.

![stats 3](stats3.png)

Use the ‘Create announcement’ button to start a new announcement.

![stats 4](stats4.png)

All of the fields with a ‘*’ are mandatory, so you need to fill them in following the GOV.UK style guide (link to above, ‘how to write text for a statistical announcement’).

Under ‘Statistics type’, only select the ‘National statistics’ option from the drop-down menu if your statistics are [accredited by ONS](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistician/types-of-official-statistics/list-of-national-statistics/index.html).

Once you’ve completed all the fields, select the ‘Save announcement’ button.

##How to amend an existing announcement

Go to the ‘Statistics announcements’ tab in Publisher.

![stats 6](stats6.png)

You’ll see a list of existing announcements. Select the announcement you want to edit.

To amend the statistics type, title, summary, organisation or topic:

* select the ‘Edit’ button
* make your amends
* have someone else check your text for errors
* select ‘Save announcement’

To amend the release date:

* select the ‘Change release date’ button
* once you’ve amended the date you have the option to [add a change note](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2013/09/09/when-should-you-add-change-notes/) to explain the change of date - this will appear on the page for the public to read
* select ‘change date’ to confirm the change

##How to link an announcement to a draft statistics publication

Once you’ve created your announcement you’ll see a message which says ‘This announcement is not yet linked to a document’. Underneath there are 2 options to link the announcement to a statistics document: 

* ‘Draft new document’ 
* ‘Link to an existing draft document’

![stats 8](stats8.png)

##Link to an existing draft document

If the draft of the statistics document is already in Publisher, then select ‘Link to an existing draft document.’ A search box will appear where you should enter the title of the document and select it from the list. This will link the 2 documents, so when you publish the statistics document, the announcement won’t show in the release calendar.

##Draft a new document

If the draft page for the document hasn’t yet been created you need to select ‘Draft new document’. This will automatically create a statistics publication page for your statistics document. Always search in Publisher first to make sure the document is not already there, and to make sure you have a unique title. 

It will auto-populate the publication type, title, summary and topic fields for you using the text from the announcement page. You will need to add the body text. Then you can save the page until you’re ready to upload the statistics publication.

##How to draft body text

The body text should reassure the user that the release is (or isn’t) what they’re looking for. The body text should:

* not be longer than 100 words
* describe what the statistics are about and their purpose
* be clear, concise and written in plain English
* provide context if there are statistics with similar titles
* not repeat the title and summary 
* not summarise what the publication says
* not include general information covered in the publication
