## Preview, submit and publish 

You can preview the body copy of your document in several ways. 

### Preview toggle

For quick checks (eg checking that your [Markdown](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/markdown.html) is correct) the preview toggle is ideal.

Toggle straight back to editing as the preview toggle does not save your work.

### Preview of document

Preview entire documents once your page is saved, using the blue 'Previewâ€™ button.

Your page opens in a new window or tab. It is an exact preview of how it will appear on the site.

### Preview of organisation home page

Sometimes before your organisation goes live you want to see what it will look like. In consultation with your transition manager, you can use the Preview site to do this. (It is the separate site for which you will have a separate login, at [https://whitehall-admin.preview.alphagov.co.uk/](https://whitehall-admin.preview.alphagov.co.uk/).)

If your pages are complete on the Production site, and the status of your organisation is set to 'Coming soon' then you can wait for Production content to be copied to Preview, and then within Preview you can put your home page live. It will be visible on the web but is password protected by the betademo password.

Make sure you don't accidentally put your home page live on the Production site before your launch date. Check the URL before changing your status to live. 

### Preview of documents for stakeholders or policy teams

You can use [fact check](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/workflow-content/fact-checking.html) to send preview documents (policies, publications, consultations etc) to people without Publisher accounts. Fact check does not currently work for organisation home pages or corporate pages.

### Submit a document for publication

Click the green 'Submit' button. Your document should be picked up by [second pair of eyes](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/workflow-content/second-pair-of-eyes.html) so it can be checked and published.

If no one is available and you need to publish your page quickly, you can force publish; ensure that the page is given a 'looks good' approval as soon as possible after this.
