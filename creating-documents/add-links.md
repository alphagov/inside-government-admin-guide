## Add links

### Add external links

You can add links anywhere in body text, but not in titles, summaries or sub-headers.

Put the text you want to click in \[square brackets\] and the external URL in curved brackets, with no space between them.

Click the preview toggle to check your URLs are valid.

An external link icon appears automatically on any non GOV.UK web addresses.

### Add internal links to GOV.UK pages

Put the text you want to click in \[square brackets\] and the internal URL in curved brackets, with no space between them.

Use the Publisher URL (like https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/government/admin/publications/221540) when linking to any document made by the ‘create new document’ button (publications, consultations, speeches etc). 

You should delete the first part of the URL and use the relative path: /government/admin/publications/221540.

###Email links

Use 'less than' and 'greater than' arrows around email addresses to make them a link, eg:

![Email link](email-link.png)

###Linking to paragraphs

If you want to link to specific paragraphs within a document, you need to mark the paragraph as linkable by placing an anchor tag below the paragraph:

\{:#heading-name}

You can link to the paragraph from the same document:

\[Sample link text](#heading-name)

or from another document:

\[Sample link text](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/managing-freshwater-fisheries#eel-decline)


### Style for links

Write clear link text to tell the user about the page they will land on if they click. It should be part of the running text, not single words and never 'click here' or similar. Make sure that there are not too many links in your text.

Don't use hover text on links.
