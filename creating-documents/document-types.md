## Document types

Before you can create a document on GOV.UK, you need to know which document type to assign it to. This page will help you decide.

There are around 10 document types; some of these types have sub-types, which are all listed here with their criteria and some further explanation about the format. 

If you need to know style points such as structure, length, tone or how to write titles and summaries for different document formats, please consult the [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/insidegovernment).

During transition, your 'content analysis' spreadsheet will map your existing content to GOV.UK document types.

Some of the sub-types are shown to users in the filters on GOV.UK search pages. It is worth having a look at how these filters work for [publications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications) and [announcements](https://www.gov.uk/government/announcements). 
   

### News article
   
News is found in the 'Announcements' section of the site. Our blog [explains why news comes under 'Announcements'](http://inside-inside-gov.tumblr.com/post/34783661077/announcements).

When creating a news article:

* make sure it stands alone (ie is not simply promotion of a speech or publication)
* tag it to policies
* tag it to ministers where they are directly involved in the story
* tag it to document series ONLY rarely - if the news story is permanently relevant to that series
* write clear [substantive change notes](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/make-a-change-note.html) if it is re-edited after publication
* use [blockquote Markdown](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/first-steps/markdown.html#blockquotes) for quotes, but no more than 2 consecutive sentences

It has 3 sub-types: news story, press release and government response. 


#### News story

A news story is written especially for GOV.UK so must keep to GOV.UK style. In particular this means jargon-free, plain English, with a logical structure and helpful sub-headers. See the [style guide: news](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/insidegovernment#news) for more guidance on structure, length etc.


#### Press release

This sub-type is for reproducing press releases once they have been sent out from departments or agencies. It should be published unedited, as sent out. Press releases can be uploaded as PDFs or cut and pasted into body copy. This sub-type is intended only for keeping a record of an organisation's press releases.

You can also use press release for an official statement by a department spokesperson or minister (but not a parliamentary statement, which should use speech format). <!--this will change soon-->


#### Government response

This is for a press statement responding to coverage in the media (but not a parliamentary statement, which should use speech format). It does not include press articles written by ministers or letters to newspapers from ministers (see speech format). 


### Speech, statement or article

This format covers all types of formal announcement made by government. Note that if an announcement has been made in this format, you don't need a news story about that announcement as it speaks for itself.


#### Speech

A speech is delivered to a specific audience and often asserts the government's message or position on an issue. When creating a speech:

* never include 'speech' in the title
* specify the audience in the title or summary (eg Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association)
* specify the message of the speech in the title and summary, keeping the title concise (65 characters)
* tag to a specific minister or director (if the speaker doesn't exist in the system you can [create a page for that person](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/editing-other-pages/people-and-roles.html))
* assign a sub-type - draft, speaking notes or transcript as delivered (this currently appears in the summary, but will soon be shown in brackets after the date)
* specify a location (eg The Banqueting House, Whitehall, London)
* never be given in Parliament (these are oral statements to Parliament - see below)
* give a date for when the speech was delivered
* never use the blockquote markdown as the speech is a quote throughout

#### Statement

A statement usually relates to matters of policy or government actions. It differs from a speech as there is no selected audience: a statement is given orally or in writing to Parliament. When creating a statement:

* specify the purpose of the statement in the title and summary
* tag to a specific minister (their photo will appear automatically in the left margin)
* assign a sub-type - written or oral
* never specify a location - this is self-evidently Parliament
* give a date for when the statement was delivered
* never use the blockquote markdown as the statement is a quote throughout

#### Authored article

An authored article is a republication of a piece written for publication elsewhere (usually a newspaper) by a minister. It does not include letters to newspapers. When creating an authored article:

* tag to a specific minister (their photo will appear automatically in the left margin)
* assign a statement type - written or oral
* include the URL of the original article in the box (coming soon!)
* never specify a location - this is self-evidently Parliament
* never use the blockquote markdown as the statement is a quote throughout



### Publication
   
A publication page carries the publication as an attachment: most publication pages carry just 1 stand-alone document.

The document can appear as various file types (HTML, PDF, Word). Note that you enter [HTML documents] as text directly into Publisher, but for other document files (PDF, Word, Excel etc) you [upload documents from local servers as attachments](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-attachments.html).

Sometimes a single publication page has multiple attachments (eg a statistical release would include the pre-release access list and perhaps some data files as supporting documents). You can also use a single publication page for serial collections of documents:

* periodicals
* transparency data that is updated regularly, 
* statistics where the same publication from previous releases needs to be to hand
* reports or strategies that are updated, where previous versions need to be to hand

Serial collections are essentially the same content item that varies over time.

Note that if the new document incorporates all the previous data (eg if you are adding data for the current month to an Excel file) you can [overwrite the attachment](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-attachments.html) rather than uploading multiple attachments. This would be preferable for the user. The document stays at the same URL.

There are a lot of publication sub-types listed below. You need to assign a sub-type to every publication.


#### Titles for publication pages and publications

At the top of the page, write a short GOV.UK style title (65 characters), free of jargon and weighted for SEO. 

Write the publication title in the box where you upload the attachment. You should reproduce the given title of the publication. This publication title is searchable on the public site.


#### Policy paper sub-type

Use this for strategy, planning or implementation of a government policy. It includes white papers, operational plans, action plans etc. 

A lot of publications are likely to fall into this category, but note that it excludes consultations, research and impact assessments. If it is a corporate report about your organisation, see below.


#### Impact assessment sub-type

This is a very specific content type for assessments of proposed initatives or regulatory changes. 

Note that impact assessments are often published before or during consultations. They should not be uploaded within the consultation, but should have their own page.


#### Guidance sub-type

Use this for manuals, handbooks and any other stand-alone documents that offer advice. You can also write guidance in a digital format as an [HTML document] (this replaces the previous web-based content type, detailed guides).


#### Form sub-type

Use this for a document that needs to be completed by users. You can include a guidance document that goes with the form on the same page as a supporting document. 


#### Statistics and national statistics sub-types

Use 'statistics' for data produced by members of the Government Statistical Service.

Use 'national statistics' for anything that meets the UK Statistics Authority's code of practice; this content automatically displays the national statistics logo.


#### Research and analysis

Use this for any research relevant to government policy.


#### Corporate reports

Use this for publications about what your organisation does; it includes annual reports, .


#### Transparency data

Use this for spending, salaries, gifts and hospitality, .




* 'FOI release' for responses to Freedom of information requests

* 'Independent reports' for reports commissioned about government from third parties

#### Correspondence

Use this for letters to individuals or organisations. Also use for newsletters


#### Promotional material

Use this for posters and leaflets that promote government services. It can include resources for other government agents or local authorities to reproduce, such as logos and images. 

Be careful with this content type. If the resource contains guidance, such as an information pack, then even if it is also promotional you should count it as the guidance sub-type.
