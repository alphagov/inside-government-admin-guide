title: Inside Government Admin Guide - Document types

## Document types

Before you can create a document on GOV.UK, you need to know which document type to assign it to. This page will help you decide.

There are around 10 document types; some of these types have sub-types. 

Once you have created a document it will stick to the type you have created (eg you cannot change a news article to a speech). However the sub-type is assigned within the document and can be changed (eg a news story could be changed to a government response).

During transition, your 'content analysis' spreadsheet will map existing content to GOV.UK document types.
   

### News article
   
News is found in the 'Announcements' section of the site. Our blog [explains why news comes under 'Announcements'](http://inside-inside-gov.tumblr.com/post/34783661077/announcements).

It has 3 sub-types: news story, press release and government response. 

#### News story

News stories are written for the web and must keep to GOV.UK style. In particular this means jargon-free, plain English, with a logical structure and helpful sub-headers. See the [style guide: news](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/insidegovernment#news) for more guidance, such as structure, length etc.

News stories are not for promoting speeches or publications that are published elsewhere on GOV.UK. You can promote the speech or publication itself in feeds, on your [home page](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/editing-other-pages/homepage.html) and in topical events. Creating 2 URLs for a single piece of content will confuse users in the search. 


#### Press release

This format is for reproducing press releases once they have been sent out from departments or agencies. It should be unedited, as sent out. A press release can be uploaded as PDFs or cut and pasted into body copy.

You can use the press release format for an official statement by a department spokesperson or minister (but not a parliamentary statement, which should use speech format).


#### Government response

Government response to coverage in the media, including through a press statement or departmental statement (but not a parliamentary statement, which should use speech format).






* 'News story' digital first stories written specifically for the site

* 'Government response' for a government response to media coverage

### Speech
   
There are five types:

* Use 'Transcript' for verbatim reports of what the speaker said (ie ‘checked against delivery’).

* 'Draft' for what the speaker was supposed to say (ie ‘check against delivery’)

* 'Speaking notes' if only notes are available

* 'Written statement' for statements submitted in writing to Parliament

* 'Oral statement' for statements given verbally to Parliament

### Policy
