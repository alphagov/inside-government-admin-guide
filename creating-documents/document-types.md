# Document types

Before you can create a document on GOV.UK, you need to know which document type to assign to it. This page will help you decide.

There are around 10 document types; some of these types have sub-types, which are all listed here with their criteria. 

If you need to know style points such as structure, length, tone or how to write titles and summaries for different content formats, please consult the [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/insidegovernment).

During transition, your 'content analysis' spreadsheet will map your existing content to GOV.UK document types.
   

## News article 
   
News is found in the 'Announcements' section of the site. Our blog [explains why news comes under 'Announcements'](http://inside-inside-gov.tumblr.com/post/34783661077/announcements).

When creating a news article:

* make sure it stands alone (ie is not simply promotion of a speech or publication - in which case use just those content types)
* tag it to policies
* tag it to ministers where they are directly involved in the story
* tag it to document series ONLY rarely - if the news story is permanently relevant to that series
* write clear [substantive change notes](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/editing-a-doc.html#change_notes) if it is re-edited after publication
* use [blockquote Markdown](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/markdown.html) for quotes, but no more than 2 consecutive sentences

### News article sub-types

#### News story 

You write a news story especially for GOV.UK so you must keep to GOV.UK style. In particular it needs jargon-free, plain English, with a logical structure and helpful sub-headers. See the [style guide: news](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/insidegovernment#news) for more guidance on structure, length etc.


#### Press release 

This sub-type is for reproducing press releases once they have been sent out from departments or agencies. You should publish it unedited, as sent out. Press releases can be uploaded as PDFs or cut and pasted into body copy. This sub-type is intended only for keeping a record of an organisation's press releases.

You can also use press release for an official statement by a department spokesperson or minister (but not a parliamentary statement, which should use speech format). 


#### Government response 

This is for a press statement responding to coverage in the media (but not a parliamentary statement, which should use speech format). It does not include press articles written by ministers or letters to newspapers from ministers (see speech format). 

You can also use government response for letters to the press from government ministers or interviews with government ministers.

## Speech, statement or article 

This format covers all types of formal announcement made by government. Note that if an announcement has been made in this format, you don't need a news story about that announcement as it speaks for itself.

### Speech, statement or article sub-types

#### Speech: transcript/draft/speaking notes 

A speech is given to a specific audience, usually during an important event or visit, and often asserts the government's message or position on an issue. 

First assign a sub-type (this currently appears in the summary, but will soon be shown in brackets after the date):

* 'draft'  for the draft the speaker uses
* 'speaking notes' (cue cards, PowerPoint notes) if no draft is available
* 'transcript' for verbatim reports of exactly what the speaker said (internally referred to as ‘checked against delivery’)

When creating a speech:

* never write 'speech' in the title
* specify the audience in the summary (eg Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association)
* specify the message of the speech in the title and summary, keeping the title concise (65 characters)
* tag to a speaker by selecting the correct minister or director (if the speaker doesn't exist in the system you can [create a page for that person](/inside-government-admin-guide/organisations-groups/people-and-roles.html))
* specify a location (eg The Banqueting House, Whitehall, London, but never Parliament as these are oral statements to Parliament - see below)
* enter a date for when the speech was given
* never use the blockquote markdown as the speech is a quote throughout

#### Statement to Parliament: written/oral 

A statement usually relates to matters of policy or government actions. It differs from a speech as there is no selected audience: a statement is given orally or in writing to Parliament. When creating a statement:

* never write 'statement' in the title
* specify the purpose of the statement in the title and summary
* tag to a speaker by selecting the correct minister (their photo will appear automatically in the left margin)
* assign a sub-type - written or oral
* never specify a location - this is self-evidently Parliament, so leave this field blank
* enter a date for when the statement was given
* never use the blockquote markdown as the statement is a quote throughout


#### Authored article 

An authored article is a republication of a piece written for publication elsewhere (usually a newspaper) by a minister. It does not include letters to newspapers, these come under news as 'government responses'. When creating an authored article:

* tag to the correct 'speaker' (ie a writer), a specific minister or director (their photo will appear automatically in the left margin)
* include the URL of the original article in the box (coming soon!)

## Publication 
   
A publication page carries the publication as an attachment: most publication pages carry just 1 stand-alone document.

The document can appear as various file types. Note that for the usual file types (PDF, Word, Excel etc) you [upload documents from local servers as attachments](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-attachments.html). Alternatively you can [create an HTML document in Publisher](/inside-government-admin-guidecreating-documents/create-an-HTML-document.html) to show on the publication page in a web-based format.


Sometimes a single publication page has multiple attachments (eg a statistical release would include the pre-release access list and perhaps some data files as supporting documents). You can also use a single publication page for serial collections of documents:

* periodicals
* transparency data that is updated regularly, 
* statistics where the same publication from previous releases needs to be to hand
* reports or strategies that are updated, where previous versions need to be to hand

Serial collections are essentially the same content item that varies over time.

Note that if the new document incorporates all the previous data (eg if you are adding data for the current month to an Excel file) you can [overwrite the attachment](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-attachments.html) rather than uploading multiple attachments. This would be preferable for the user. The document stays at the same URL.

The publication sub-types are listed below. When creating a publication you need to:

* assign a sub-type to every publication
* tag to policy (always, except for transparency publications)
* tag to [document series](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/organisations-groups/document-series.html) where possible
* follow style for titles, remembering the difference between the page title and a publication title
* follow style for summaries, explained in the [create a document section.](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/create-a-new-doc.html)


### Titles for publication pages and publications

At the top of the page, write a short GOV.UK style title (65 characters), free of jargon and weighted for SEO. 

Type the publication title in the box where you upload the attachment. You should reproduce the given title of the publication. This publication title is searchable on the public site.

[Instructions on how to create a document.](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/create-a-new-doc.html)

### Publication sub-types

#### Policy paper 

Use this for strategy, planning or implementation of a government policy. It includes white papers, operational plans, action plans etc. 

A lot of publications are likely to fall into this category, but note that it excludes annual reports and business plans (which are corporate reports) and consultations. 


#### Corporate report 

Use this for publications about what your organisation does and how it works; it includes annual reports, business plans, structural reform plans (though strategic plans should be policy papers), reviews of performance such as efficiency reviews (though performance data would come under transparency data).


#### Independent report 

Use this for reports commissioned about government policy from third parties, including enquiries, investigations, research and reviews.


#### Guidance 

Use this for manuals, handbooks and any other stand-alone documents that offer advice. You can also write guidance in a digital format as an HTML document (this replaces the previous web-based content type, detailed guides).


#### Form 

Use this only for a document that needs to be completed by users online or in hard copy. Most forms have guidance included on them, but if it is a separate guidance document that goes with the form, then upload it to the same page as a supporting document. 


#### Impact assessment 

This is a very specific content type for assessments of proposed initatives or regulatory changes. 

Note that impact assessments are often published before or during consultations. They should not be uploaded within the consultation, but should each have their own page.


#### Statistics and national statistics 

Use 'statistics' for official statistics produced by members of the Government Statistical Service.

Use 'national statistics' for official statistical releases and reports that meet the UK Statistics Authority's code of practice: this content automatically displays the national statistics logo.

There is a special tickbox you can use to [limit access to producing organisations prior to publication](/inside-government-admin-guide/workflow-content/limiting-access.html), which is particularly useful for statistics.


#### Research and analysis 

Use this for research documents relevant to government policy. The research is likely to be carried out within government. If the research has been carried out independently or commissioned from an outside source then it is probably an independent report (see below).


#### Transparency data 

Use this for documents that record spending, salaries, gifts and hospitality. Organise and name the documents according to your organisation's agreed [publication scheme](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/insidegovernment#publication-scheme), which will appear as a corporate page. 

The titles should include your organisation's acronym so that the document is not easily confused with others - 'DfT special advisers: gifts and hospitality received, 13 May to 31 July 2010'.


#### FOI release 

Use this for responses to Freedom of information requests. Add the reference number in the attachment associations - this is searchable.


#### Correspondence 

Use this for letters to individuals or organisations. Also use for newsletters and bulletins (unless these are guidance, in which case use the guidance sub-type).


#### Promotional material 

Use this for posters and leaflets that promote government services. It can include resources for other government agents or local authorities to reproduce, such as logos and images. 

Be careful with this content type. If the resource contains guidance, such as an information pack, then even if it is also promotional you should count it as the guidance sub-type.

## Policy 
   
Clear and complete definition of government policy on a specific issue. Policy supporting detail pages can be added after the policy is created and saved.

You would need to read several examples of policy before creating a new one or editing an existing one. You need to have discussions with GDS and your sponsoring department before you can create a new policy.


## Consultation 
   
Use this for all kinds of consultation including calls for evidence. All content for the various stages of a consultation (open, closed, public response, government response) are added to the same page as the timeline progresses.

This page has [full instructions on launching, updating and concluding a consultation](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/launch-consultations.html).


## Case study 
   
A real world example that shows best practice, illustrates an issue or demonstrates policy in action. Should be useful on an ongoing basis, create a news story if not.


## Fatality notice 
   
Ministry of Defence only: a news style content type announcing the death of a member of the armed forces.


## Worldwide priority 
   
Definitions of UK government priorities in international locations. These are only published by people authorised by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office.

Some of the sub-types are shown to users in the filters on GOV.UK search pages. It is worth having a look at how these filters work for [publications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications) and [announcements](https://www.gov.uk/government/announcements). For example written and oral statements are grouped under the term 'Statements to Parliament', under Announcements.
