## Add associations (metadata and tagging)

You can tag your document to organisations, topics, policies, ministers and international locations (depending on content format).

Associations are found below the document body text, just underneath the upload images section. 
	
* Click within the association field drop-down menu appears showing all the possible values you can enter.  	
* Start typing and it will narrow down your available options.

* To remove it, click the ‘x’.
	
## Choose which associations to use

Use associations sparingly. On policies or topics, for example, 1 is best and any more than 3 is too many.

#### Associations for publications and consultations

* Tag to policy/policies all publications and consultations except transparency data. You should know your sponsoring department's policies and be aware which content relates to which policy. 
* Tag to topic/topics only if you cannot identify a policy - this acts as a back-up (tagging to topics is coming soon).
* Tag to organisations and alternative format providers in all cases (this will default to your own organisation). You should already be aware of your alternative format provider. These fields are mandatory.
* Tag to document series to help users to find content. You may wish to [create a document series](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/editing-other-pages/document-series.html) for your content and related documents, but be aware that document series form an information architcture for your organisation, so they can't be created in an ad hoc way.
* Tag to ministers only in cases of direct involvement (eg writing the foreword).
* Tag to topical events only if relevant.
* Tag to worldwide locations and priorities only if you are working for the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and know how to use these tags.

#### Associations for announcements

Speeches are tagged to their speakers in all cases, so ministers do not appear in the associations list. 

* Tag to policy/policies all announcements (inclulding news). You should know your sponsoring department's policies and be aware which content relates to which policy. 
* Tag to topic/topics only if you cannot identify a policy - this acts as a back-up (tagging to topics is coming soon).
* Tag to organisations and alternative format providers in all cases (this will default to your own organisation). You should already be aware of your alternative format provider. These fields are mandatory.
* Tag to document series only if relevant - document series are more suited to publications (see above).
* Tag news to ministers or other people only in cases of direct involvement (eg a minister's visit).
* Tag to topical events only if relevant.
* Tag to worldwide locations and priorities only if you are working for the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and know how to use these tags.
