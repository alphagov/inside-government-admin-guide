## Second pair of eyes, force publishing and ‘looks good’

1. Documents should be submitted to a second pair of eyes to check against the [Style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide).

	Click the ‘Submit’ button and the content joins the ‘Submitted’ queue.

2. Another editor can then Edit, Publish or Reject it.

	When your content is published you will be notified by email.
	
	If your content is rejected you will also be notified by email.

3. It is still possible to publish immediately, although this should only be used in emergencies.

	If you have ‘Departmental editor’ status, you’ll see a ‘Force Publish’ button. Click this and your content will go live immediately.

4. Force Published content is flagged and should be checked by a second pair of eyes as soon as possible.

	If you Force Publish a page, you'll see a 'not reviewed' label next to its title.

5. To clear this label, ask a fellow editor to check the page against the style guide.

	If page is OK, the editor can click ‘Looks good’.
