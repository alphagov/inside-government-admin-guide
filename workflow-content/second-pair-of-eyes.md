## Second pair of eyes, force publishing and ‘looks good’

Documents should be submitted to a second pair of eyes to check against the [Style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide).

Click the ‘Submit’ button and the content joins the ‘Submitted’ queue.

Another editor can then Edit, Publish or Reject it.

When your content is either published or rejected you will be notified by email.

###Force publishing

It is still possible to publish immediately. Only do this in an emergency. You'll have to submit a valid reason why you're force publishing without another editor checking your work, as this is bad publishing practice. GDS is monitoring how this functionality is being used, including reasons for force publishing.

If you have ‘Departmental editor’ status, you’ll see a ‘Force Publish’ button. Click this and your content will go live immediately.

Force Published content is flagged and should be checked by a second pair of eyes as soon as possible.

If you Force Publish a page, you'll see a 'not reviewed' label next to its title.

To clear this label, ask a fellow editor to check the page against the style guide.

If page is OK, the editor can click ‘Looks good’.
