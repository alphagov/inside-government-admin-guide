## Second pair of eyes, force publishing and ‘looks good’

Documents should be submitted to a second pair of eyes to check against the [Style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide).

Click the ‘Submit’ button and the content joins the ‘Submitted’ queue.

Another editor can then Edit, Publish or Reject it. You'll get an email if it's published or rejected back to you to fix.

In an emergency you can publish items without getting them checked by a second editor if you have 'editor' permissions. This is bad publishing practice, so don't do it unless it's necessary and always get the content checked as soon as possible afterwards.

###How to force publish

Hit the yellow 'Force publish' button on the right.

You'll need to provide a valid reason why you're force publishing. If you enter meaningless text or a poor reason, GDS will raise this.

Force Published content is flagged and should be checked by a second pair of eyes as soon as possible.

If you force publish a page, you'll see a 'not reviewed' label next to its title.

To clear this label, ask a fellow editor to check the page against the style guide.

If page is OK, the editor can click ‘Looks good’.
