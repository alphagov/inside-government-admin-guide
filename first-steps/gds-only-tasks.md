* deleting published pages and redirecting users to live superseding pages
* deleting published pages and redirecting to the same page on The National Archives 

(For deletions, it helps if you give the internal link for the page to be deleted and the public URL of the redirect.)

* deleting document series
* deleting organisations, teams, roles or people
* adding friendly URLs (FURLs) like https://www.gov.uk/G8
