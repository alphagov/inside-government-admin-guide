## Help from GDS

The Government Digital Service (GDS) will be offering direct support to agencies in transition and continuing support to departments and agencies that have transitioned. 

Please use the [support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/) for queries about Publisher that are not answered in this manual.

You can also ask GDS to:

* delete pages
* create friendly URLs (FURLs)
* create topical events
* create new organisations or ministerial roles
* create worldwide organisations

You can also ask us (or tell us) about your needs for Publisher:

* tell us about new user needs
* request new features
* report bugs or issues
* request analytics reports
* general feedback

Basically, anything which you think requires an action on our part should be raised through that form.
