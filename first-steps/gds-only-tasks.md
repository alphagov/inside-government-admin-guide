## Deleting content, friendly URLs, creating organisations

Content deletion is the process of unpublishing a page (so it doesn't show on the site) and redirecting the user (automatically or with a message) to the correct content on GOV.UK or in The National Archives. At present this can only be carried out by GDS. 

Please use the [support form](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk/users/sign_in) to request these from us, the Government Digital Service (GDS). It helps if you give the internal link for the page to be deleted and the public URL of the redirect. Other content items can also be archived on request, such as document series. People and organisations are not usually deleted, use the support form to ask if you aren't sure. 

### Unpublishing pages

You can ask GDS to:

* unpublish a page and redirect users to a live superseding page
* unpubish a page and redirect to the same page on The National Archives 
* unpublish a page published in error, with no redirect (for pages that will be published again soon)

Once a page has been unpublished, it reverts to draft status. It is then your job to delete it and it will go into the archive. You can also ask GDS to:

* archive a document series
* archive an organisation, group, team or role


### Friendly URLs

Please use the [support form](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk/users/sign_in) to request friendly URLs (FURLs) like https://www.gov.uk/G8. FURLs are always offered to organisations and topical events. Other requests for short URLs are considered.


### Creating organisations or other content items

These tasks can be carried out by departmental editors, but GDS should be consulted first so please use the [support form](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk/users/sign_in) to request permission:

* creating organisations and sub orgs (creating teams or advisory groups is OK)
* creating ministerial people or roles (creating managerial ie board member roles are OK)
* creating topics or topical events
* creating worldwide organisations


### Not possible

These tasks cannot (yet) be carried out:

* changing the URL of a page (you will need to create a new page and fix the URL to what you want, then request a deletion and redirection using the [support form](https://signon.production.alphagov.co.uk/users/sign_in)
* duplicating a page (you’ll need create a new page and use copy and paste)
* moving a page from Preview to Production (you’ll need create a new page and use copy and paste)
* changing a document’s main type (eg from a news story to a publication)
