## Your dashboard

When you log into Publisher the first screen you see is your dashboard. 

   ![Start screen 2](start-screen-2.png)

From your dashboard there are links to support tools.

Underneath this, your dashboard lists the most recent draft documents you have been working on and your organisation's force-published documents (which need ['second eye'](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/second-pair-of-eyes.html).

Using the [top navigation](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/first-steps/top-navigation.html), you can:

*  create new content 
*  click through to 'Documents', which lists all documents produced by departments and agencies, with a set of [document filters](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/first-steps/document-filters.html)
*  click through to 'Document series'
*  click through to 'Your organisation', which is where you control the [home page](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/editing-other-pages/homepage.html) for your department or agency
