## Your dashboard

When you log into Publisher the first screen you see is your dashboard. 

   ![Start screen 2](start-screen-2.png)

From your dashboard there are links to support and guidance:

* Admin user guide - this Publisher manual 
* [Content principles](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide) - the style guide
* [Inside GOV.UK](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/) - the blog for GOV.UK writers and editors
* [Development backlog](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/367813) - the Pivotal tracker 
* [GDS support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/) - for requests to GDS

Underneath this, your dashboard lists the most recent draft documents you have been working on and your organisation's force-published documents (which need ['second eye'](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/workflow-content/second-pair-of-eyes.html)).

Using the top navigation, you can:

*  click the plus sign to [create new content](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/create-a-new-doc.html) 
*  click through to 'Documents', which lists all documents produced by departments and agencies, with a set of document filters to help you find particular documents
*  click through to 'Document series', where you can create [document series](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/organisations-groups/document-series.html) to group your documents
*  click through to 'Your organisation', which is where you control the [home page](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/organisations-groups/organisation-home-page.html) for your department or agency and can [select the content to feature on your home page](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/organisations-groups/feature-documents-home-page.html)
