*  click through to 'Documents', which lists all documents produced by departments and agencies, with a set of document filters to help you find particular documents
*  click through to 'Document series', where you can create [document series](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/editing-other-pages/document-series.html) to group your documents
*  click through to 'Your organisation', which is where you control the [home page](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/editing-other-pages/organisation-home-page.html) for your department or agency
