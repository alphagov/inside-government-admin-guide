## Find documents - using the filters on Publisher

Click on the 'Documents' link on the top navigation to get to the full list of documents on GOV.UK. 

![Document hub 1](document-hub-2.png)

There are thousands of documents on GOV.UK. The filters down the left hand side of the page help you to narrow down the list to find the document you want.

![Document filters 1](document-filters-1.png)

You can use just one filter or several - they will all act together.


### Filter by title or slug

You can filter using consecutive words from the document's title or the slug of the public-facing URL on GOV.UK (for example 'making-roads-safer').

![Document filters 2](document-filters-2.png)

The search filters the text to find the words you type. Type in consecutive words from the title or a slug (including hyphens) and hit return.

### Filter by author or organisation

You can filter documents by any department or agency, or you can find documents that have been created or edited by yourself or other colleagues.

* Click on 'Me' to bring up documents that you have created or edited.
* Click on 'My department' for all documents written by members of your team. 
* Use the dropdown menu for other organisations, or start typing the organisation name to find them more quickly.

![Document filters 4](document-filters-4.png)

* Click on 'Everyone' to see all documents. 
* Use the dropdown menu for other authors, or start typing a colleague's name to find them more quickly.

### Filter by world location   

Government offices overseas can filter documents by their world location (generally a country).

![Document filters 6](document-filters-6.png)

* Start typing a world location into the search box. 
* Click on the search box to open a dropdown menu you can pick from.


### Filter by kind

You can filter documents by their type (publication, policy, news article etc).

![Document filters 7](document-filters-7.png)

* Click on ‘Policies’ and the document list will update to show only policies.
* Click ‘All’ to see every document type again.


### Filter by state

You can filter documents by their state (draft, scheduled, published etc).

![Document filters 8](document-filters-8.png)

* ‘All’ shows every document.
* 'Imported (pre-draft)' is used by departments and agencies in transition. Click on it to see documents that have been imported ready for editing.
* 'Drafts' shows documents that are a work in progress.
* 'Submitted' shows documents waiting for a second pair of eyes to look at them. You should always submit documents rather than publish them yourself except when you are obliged to [force publish](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/workflow-content/second-pair-of-eyes).
* 'Rejected' shows documents that have been rejected by a second pair of eyes.
* 'Scheduled' lists documents that are scheduled to be published at a specified date and time.
* 'Published' shows every document that’s live on GOV.UK.
