## Find documents - using the filters on Publisher

Click on the 'Documents' link on the top navigation to get to the full list of documents on GOV.UK. 

![Document hub 1](top-navigation-2.png)

There are thousands of documents on GOV.UK. The filters down the left hand side of the page help you to narrow down the list to find the document you want.

![Document filters 1](document-filters-1.png)

You can use just one filter or several - they will all act together.


### Filter by title or slug

You can filter using consecutive words from the document's title or the slug of the public-facing URL on GOV.UK (for example 'making-roads-safer').

![Document filters 2](document-filters-2.png)

The search filters the text to find the words you type. Type in consecutive words from the title or a slug (including hyphens) and hit return.

### Filter by author or organisation

You can find documents that have been created or edited by yourself or other colleagues. Click on 'Me' to see documents you have created or edited, or start typing a colleague's name to find them quickly.

Start typing a word from your organisation's name to bring it up quickly. This will show all the documents for which your department is a lead or a supporting organisation.

### Filter by world location   

Government offices overseas can filter documents by their world location (generally a country).

![Document filters 6](document-filters-6.png)

* Start typing a world location into the search box. 
* Click on the search box to open a dropdown menu you can pick from.


### Filter by kind

You can filter documents by their type (publication, policy, news article etc).

![Document filters 7](document-filters-7.png)

* Click on ‘Policies’ and the document list will update to show only policies.
* Click ‘All’ to see every document type again.

Scroll further down the list to find the document sub-types.

### Filter by state

You can filter documents by their state (draft, scheduled, published etc).

![Document filters 8](document-filters-8.png)

* 'Imported (pre-draft)' is used by departments and agencies in transition. Click on it to see documents that have been imported ready for editing.
* 'Drafts' shows documents that are a work in progress.
* 'Submitted' shows documents waiting for a second pair of eyes to look at them. You should always submit documents rather than publish them yourself except when you are obliged to [force publish](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/workflow-content/second-pair-of-eyes).
* 'Rejected' shows documents that have been rejected by a second pair of eyes.
* 'Scheduled' lists documents that are scheduled to be published at a specified date and time.
* 'Published' shows every document that’s live on GOV.UK.
* 'Force published (not reviewed)' shows all documents that [need a second eye](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/workflow-content/second-pair-of-eyes.html).


### Filter by date

You can filter documents by the last date they were edited, using the 'from' and 'to' fields. (The greyed out dates are just a guide to the format.)

### Clearing the filters

![Document filters 11](document-filters-11.png)

To clear a filter and return to showing 'all', you need to click on the 'X'.
