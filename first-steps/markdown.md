## Markdown

*  The publishing system uses ‘Markdown’ to format the content. Rather than using editor tools or coding in html, you can type simple commands within the copy to create the formatting you want. 
*  Wherever you are editing, you’ll see a ‘how to’ guide like the one below. It’s under the tab called ‘Formatting help’. You can cut and paste the text if you get stuck.

### Headers and sub-headers

*  Use 2 hashtags (\##) for a main heading and 3 or 4 hashtags for sub-headings. These are your H2s, H3s and H4s.
*  Don't use 1 hashtag or you will get a title heading in the middle of your document. The box where you enter the title will assign it the H1 style automatically, you don't need to use Markdown in this box.

The 'Create a document' section has more about [titles, summaries and sub-headers.](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/creating-a-new-doc#titles.html)


### Links

*  Use square brackets for the link text and round brackets for the link URL.
*  Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets.

The [Add links](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-links.html) section explains how to make internal and external linking.


### Bullets

*  Use asterisks (\*) to make a bulleted list.
*  You need 1 empty line space before the bullets start, and 1 at the end.
*  Make sure there is 1 space after the asterisk and all the bullets line up correctly. 
*  Sub-items need an indent of 2 spaces.

See the [style guide on bullets](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide#bullet-points-and-steps) to check how to punctuate them.


### Tables

*  Use dividers (\|) to make tables.
*  You need 1 empty line space before the table starts and 1 at the end.
*  Make sure every row has the same number of dividers - use \| | for an empty cell.
*  Use \|---|---| to create a tinted header row at the top.
*  No Markdown within a table, but you can use html if you need links in your table.


### Call to action

*  Use \$CTA to make a tinted box to draw attention to a call to action.
*  This is only for short links to purposeful actions like applying for a licence.

See the [style guide on linking](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide#links) for more advice about writing links.


### Acronyms

Acronyms like Rural Payments Agency (RPA) should be spelt out on the first mention with the acronym in round brackets. Use the acronym on its own throughout the rest of the document - RPA - and put your Markdown at the end. 

The full name will show when the user hovers over the acronym where it appears in the text.

*  Leave 1 empty line space then list every acronym on a new line at the base of the document.
*  Use an asterisk, square brackets and a colon to create acronym expanders.
*  Make sure there is no space between the asterisk and the square brackets.
*  List both plurals and singulars, but not possessives like DFT's.
*  List plurals ahead of singulars (eg HGVs must be before HGV).
*  No need to list acronyms that appear only once.

*[RPA]: Rural Payments Agency
