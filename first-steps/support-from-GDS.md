## Support from GDS

The Government Digital Service (GDS) will be offering support to agencies in transition and departments and agencies that have transitioned. 

Please use the [support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/) for queries about Publisher that are not answered in this manual. (You'll need to be logged in to access this form.)

You can also use the form to ask GDS to:

* [delete pages](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/delete-unpublish.html) 
* [create friendly URLs (FURLs)](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/delete-unpublish.html)
* create topical events
* create new organisations or ministerial roles
* create worldwide organisations

You can also tell us about your needs for Publisher, or request:

* new user needs that current formats don't accommodate
* new formats and functionality for the government section of GOV.UK
* bugs or issues
* analytics reports
* general feedback
