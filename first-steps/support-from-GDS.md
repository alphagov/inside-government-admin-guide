## Support from GDS

The Government Digital Service (GDS) will be offering direct support to agencies in transition and continuing support to departments and agencies that have transitioned. 

Please use the [support form](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/) for queries about Publisher that are not answered in this manual. (You'll need to be logged in to access this form.)

You can also ask GDS to:

* [delete pages](/creating-documents/delete-unpublish.html) 
* [create friendly URLs (FURLs)](/creating-documents/delete-unpublish.html)
* create topical events
* create new organisations or ministerial roles
* create worldwide organisations

You can also tell us about your needs for Publisher, or report problems like:

* new user needs that current formats don't accommodate
* new features
* bugs or issues
* analytics reports
* general feedback

Basically, anything which you think requires an action on our part should be raised through that form.
