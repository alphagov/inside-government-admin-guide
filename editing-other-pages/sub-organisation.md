## Sub-organisation

1. Sub-orgs are high profile groups that have sufficient public profile and publishing activity to warrant an org-lite presence, nested beneath a parent body. 

	Please check with GDS before using this type.
	
	Any changes made to these pages will go live as soon as you save them. So double check everything before you click ‘Save’.
	
2. To create one, first click on ‘Departments & agencies’.
