# Feature content on your home page

Feature content with photos on your home page to draw attention to current stories or important publications or announcements. 

Each organisation can feature up to 6 pieces of content (eg collections, detailed guides, news stories, publications, speeches, consultations) on its home page. 

You can feature:

* content items that exist within the Departments and Policy area of GOV.UK
* topical events

You can also feature links to content that sits outside Publisher. These are:

* blogposts
* alerts
* campaigns
* services
* careers

You can only feature links to .gov.uk domains and the majority of your featured links should point to destinations within GOV.UK.
