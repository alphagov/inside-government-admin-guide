## Feature documents on your home page

Feature documents with photos on your home page to draw attention to current stories or important publications or announcements. 

Each organisation can feature up to 6 documents (eg news stories, publications, speeches, consultations) on its home page.

You can change the order of featured documents. The first document featured will be the most prominent, then you can feature up to 5 more - they will slot into place below the first feature leaving no gaps.

* Click and drag an item up or down in the list.
* When you're done setting the order, click 'Save'.
