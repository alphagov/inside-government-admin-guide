Closed organisations - scenarios and proposed wording

There are 7 options in Publisher for describing ‘closed’ organisations, each of which generates slightly different wording for users, as follows.

For many of these, you’ll need to enter the name of the organisation taking over from (superseding) the closed organisation and - if you have it - the closure date.
