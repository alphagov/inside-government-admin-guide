# Closing an organisation

##How to close an organisation

Open the organisation’s main page in Publisher. You can find ‘Departments & agencies’ under the ‘More’ tab.

Change its ‘Status on GOV.UK’ from ‘Currently live’ to ‘Closed’. 

Under the ‘Reason for closure’ menu that appears, choose the appropriate option as this affects what users will see. You can also choose the date the organisation closed.

## What a closed organisation page will look like

There are different options in Publisher for describing ‘closed’ organisations, each of which generates slightly different wording for users, as follows.

You’ll often need to enter the name of the organisation taking over from (superseding) the closed organisation and - if you have it - the date it closed.
