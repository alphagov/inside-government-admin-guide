##Team

A team is a group within an organisation responsible for a particular area. For example, the [high speed rail team](https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-teams/high-speed-rail-team).

It appears as a link in the metadata on the policy and in the top tab for the department/agency.

To create one, first click on 'Teams' under the 'More' button on the top menu.

Then click on ‘Create team’.

Enter the name, email address and description of the team.

Any changes you make to these pages will go live as soon as you save them. So double check everything before you click ‘Save’.

To associate a team with a policy, go into the policy and select the team you've created from the menu under 'Who's working on this?'.

## Policy advisory group

Policy advisory groups are groups or committees that have input to a policy. You can include a description, contact details and attached meeting papers. 

Policy advisory groups are often but not always made up of external experts or stakeholders. Members are not modelled as people and roles, just listed in the description or in an attached file.

To create one, first click on ‘Policy advisory groups’.
