## Add translated content

You can add one or more translations for any published document on GOV.UK in any of 48 languages - this includes all the languages used by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, and Welsh for UK documents. Note that you need to input the translated text, this is not a translation tool.

* First, [create a document](/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/create-a-new-doc.html) in English as normal.
* Click the 'Translations' tab.
* Select the language for your translation.

* Type or paste in the translated title, summary and body copy then save your document.

* When youâ€™re done, add another translation if you need to.


### Add attachments

If you want to upload a Word document or PDF in the language, follow the guidance for [how to add attachments](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/add-attachments.html). 

Publications have all their attachments added to both the English and the language versions of the page; you can't alter this. 

For news or HTML publications, you can add the attachments you select using Markdown, so you can add English attachments to your English version and translated attachments to your language version. 

Not that after a document is published you need to add a [change note](http://alphagov.github.io/inside-government-admin-guide/creating-documents/editing-a-doc.html) when you edit it.
